## What is this?

This is the source code for my personal homepage. I share it here so that other developers can see how I made my website and how it's structured, built, deployed, etc.

## Building and serving the site

I used a tool called [11ty][1] to build the site and serve it locally during development. There's an `npm start` script in `package.json` that will do just that. There's also a `build` script that prepares the site to be served somewhere -- I used [Netlify][2], but you can serve 11ty sites anywhere static sites are supported, I think.

## Licensing

The content of this site is licensed under [CC BY-NC-ND 4.0][3], so that you can view the code but you can't create derivatives or commercialize the content. I don't see why anyone would want to create a copy of my personal website unless it was for a bad purpose, so this should be good enough for the curious while preventing abuse.
